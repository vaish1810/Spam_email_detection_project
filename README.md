# Spam_email_detection_project
This project deals with classifying an Email as a **spam or ham i.e not spam**
For executing this task i have used **NAIVE BAYES MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHM**

SPAM EMAIL DETECTION is a classification problems wherein we can see our dataset having two classes "spam" & "ham".
Our goal is to classify our dataset or we can say our emails into spam & ham class.
I have used Naive bayes Machine Learning algorithm since it is easy to implement & provides better accuracy of the model.

**Naive Bayes Algorithm**
It is based on the Bayes Theorem for calculating probabilities and conditional probabilities

it is a classification technique based on Bayesâ€™ Theorem with an assumption of independence among predictors. 

In simple terms, a Naive Bayes classifier assumes that the presence of a particular feature in a class is unrelated to the presence of any other feature.

Naive Bayes model is easy to build and particularly useful for very large data sets.

Along with simplicity, Naive Bayes is known to outperform even highly sophisticated classification methods.

Bayes theorem provides a way of calculating posterior probability P(c|x) from P(c), P(x) and P(x|c). 

Look at the equation below:

**P(c/x)=(P(x/c)*P(c))/P(x)**

P(c|x) is the posterior probability of class (c, target) given predictor (x, attributes).

P(c) is the prior probability of class.

P(x|c) is the likelihood which is the probability of predictor given class.

P(x) is the prior probability of predictor.
